[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:53 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findjoint_trajectory_controller.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "joint_trajectory_controller", but CMake did
  not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "joint_trajectory_controller" with any of the following names:

    joint_trajectory_controllerConfig.cmake
    joint_trajectory_controller-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "joint_trajectory_controller" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "joint_trajectory_controller_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "joint_trajectory_controller"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
