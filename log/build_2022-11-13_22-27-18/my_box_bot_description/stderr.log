[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:54 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findvelocity_controllers.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "velocity_controllers", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "velocity_controllers" with any of the following names:

    velocity_controllersConfig.cmake
    velocity_controllers-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "velocity_controllers" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "velocity_controllers_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "velocity_controllers" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
